# Styling

## With React

- reuse components, the more we reuse components the less things we will need to change

- components > partials way ie react is better

```html
<p class="coolStyle">here</p>
... ... someother file
<p class="coolStyle">here</p>
```

- you writing these in js and js is more functional than css
